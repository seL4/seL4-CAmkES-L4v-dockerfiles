# Setup user and groups for inside the container

# It seems that clashes with group names or GIDs is more common
# than one might think. Here we attempt to make a matching group
# inside the container, but if it fails, we abandon the attempt.

# Try to create the group to match the GID. If a group already exists
# with that name, but a different GID, no change will be made.
# We therefore run groupmod to ensure the GID does match what was
# requested.
# However, either of these steps could fail - but if they do,
# that's OK.

    # with the corresponding group

    # nice, but still works fine.

##################### Warning! #####################################
This is an ephemeral docker container! You can do things to it using
sudo, but when you exit, changes made outside of the /host directory
will be lost.
If you want your changes to be permanent, add them to the
    extras.dockerfile
in the seL4-CAmkES-L4v dockerfiles repo.
